#   FIREWALL.

### What is it?
 * A  firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
 * A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.
   * Firewalls are categorized as a network-based or a host-based system. 
     * Network-based firewalls can be positioned anywhere within a LAN or WAN.
       * They are either a software appliance running on general-purpose hardware, a hardware appliance running on special-purpose hardware, or a virtual appliance running on a virtual host controlled by a hypervisor.
       * Firewall appliances may also offer non firewall functionality, such as DHCP or VPN services.
     * Host-based firewalls are deployed directly on the host itself to control network traffic or other computing resources.
       * This can be a daemon or service as a part of the operating system or an agent application for protection.
